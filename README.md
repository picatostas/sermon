# Serial Monitor

This is a simple multiplatform serial monitor application built with tkinter.

## Motivation

I've been developing most of this functionality as part of another personal project and I decided
to release it as a standalone application.
There is currently no available standalone serial monitor application for Mac.

## Features

- Multiplatform support (Windows, Linux, Mac)
- Easy-to-use GUI built with tkinter
- Connect to serial devices through a simple interface
- Adjustable baud rate and data bits
- Copy and save output to clipboard or file.
- Set the output format for upcoming output to: ASCII, hex, binary.
- Resizeable window
- Settings profiles

## Future Features

- themes
- support sending hex and binary data, currently it's only text.
